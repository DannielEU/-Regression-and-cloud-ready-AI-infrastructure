  AUTOMATIC COPILOT EVALUATION – TA GRADING REPORT
  Course: Digital Transformation and Enterprise Architecture
  Topic:  Stellar Luminosity – Regression from First Principles
===========================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
-----------------------------------------------------------
The repository presents a solid, technically correct implementation of
linear and polynomial regression from first principles using only NumPy
and Matplotlib. Both notebooks are well-organized, the datasets are
defined inline, and the core mathematics (MSE, gradient derivation,
vectorized operations, feature engineering, normalization) are correctly
implemented. The main weaknesses are the absence of convergence curves
(loss vs. epoch plots) in both notebooks, the missing final-fit
visualization in Notebook 1, the non-vectorized gradient descent being
defined but never independently exercised in training, and limited
interpretive commentary on the inference result in Notebook 2. Cloud
evidence is present but the README image links omit the img/ subfolder
prefix (they reference image*.png in the root instead of img/image*.png),
and no explicit local-vs-cloud
comparison is provided. Overall the submission demonstrates sound
understanding of the subject matter.

GRADING BREAKDOWN  (0.0 – 5.0 scale)
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. REPOSITORY STRUCTURE & COMPLIANCE        Score: 0.5 / 0.5
   ✔ README.md present and descriptive.
   ✔ Two notebooks clearly covering Part I and Part II.
   ✔ All datasets defined inside the notebooks.
   ✔ Only NumPy and Matplotlib used (mpl_toolkits.mplot3d is part of
     Matplotlib); no scikit-learn or other ML libraries.
   No deductions.

---

2. NOTEBOOK 1 – LINEAR REGRESSION          Score: 1.4 / 2.0

   What is present and correct:
   ✔ Dataset defined inline; scatter plot with axis labels.
   ✔ Markdown explains that the relationship is non-linear, anticipating
     model limitations – good conceptual framing.
   ✔ predict() and mse_loss() implemented correctly.
   ✔ Cost surface J(w,b) computed on a full grid and rendered as a 3D
     surface (viridis colormap) – MANDATORY item satisfied.
   ✔ Both non-vectorized (gradients_loop) and vectorized
     (gradients_vectorized) gradient functions correctly derived and
     implemented.
   ✔ Three learning rates tested (lr = 0.001, 0.01, 0.05) – MANDATORY
     item satisfied.
   ✔ Conceptual discussion of the meaning of w and limits of linearity
     provided in the final markdown cell.

   Deductions:
   – Convergence plot (loss vs. epoch) is MISSING (-0.3).
     Cell 15 only prints the final scalar loss for each learning rate;
     no curve is produced. This is a MANDATORY item.
   – The non-vectorized gradient function (gradients_loop) is defined
     but the train() function always calls gradients_vectorized. There
     is no separate demonstration that gradients_loop produces the same
     result or that it is used for training. (-0.1)
   – Final fit plot (predicted line overlaid on data scatter) is
     absent. (-0.2)

---

3. NOTEBOOK 2 – POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION      Score: 1.7 / 2.0

   What is present and correct:
   ✔ Dataset defined inline with M, T, L arrays.
   ✔ Scatter plot using temperature as colormap (plasma) – good
     visualization of a two-feature relationship.
   ✔ Feature engineering correctly implements all three design matrices:
       M1 = [M, T]
       M2 = [M, T, M²]
       M3 = [M, T, M², M·T]
   ✔ Z-score normalization applied before training – good practice.
   ✔ Vectorized predict(), mse(), and gradients() correctly implemented
     using matrix operations (X @ w).
   ✔ M1, M2, M3 trained and final losses printed – MANDATORY feature
     selection comparison satisfied.
   ✔ w_MT sweep (interaction cost analysis) implemented and plotted –
     MANDATORY item satisfied.
   ✔ Inference example for M=1.3, T=6600 K present – MANDATORY item
     satisfied.

   Deductions:
   – Convergence plot (loss vs. epoch for each model) is MISSING (-0.2).
     Cell 12 records losses[] but never plots them; training dynamics
     cannot be assessed visually.
   – Inference interpretation is minimal: only the raw predicted number
     is printed, with no surrounding discussion of what the value means
     physically or whether it is plausible. (-0.1)

---

4. CLOUD EXECUTION EVIDENCE (SageMaker)    Score: 0.3 / 0.5

   ✔ README contains an "AWS SageMaker" section and states that the
     project was executed there.
   ✔ Three PNG screenshots are present in the repository (img/ folder)
     and appear to show notebook execution inside SageMaker
     (1919×1077 – 1914×1089 pixels, full-screen browser shots).

   Deductions:
   – README image links are broken: they reference image.png,
     image-1.png, image-2.png in the root, but the files are stored
     under img/. Screenshots cannot be rendered by a reader following
     the README as-is. (-0.1)
   – No explicit local vs. cloud comparison (e.g., execution time,
     environment differences, reproducibility notes) is provided. (-0.1)

TOTAL SCORE:  3.9 / 5.0

-----------------------------------------------------------
FINAL GRADE
-----------------------------------------------------------
Final grade: 3.9 / 5.0

Result: PASS  (minimum passing grade: 3.0 / 5.0)

-----------------------------------------------------------
STRENGTHS
-----------------------------------------------------------
• Clean, readable code with consistent naming and logical cell flow.
• Both gradient functions (loop and vectorized) are mathematically
  correct; the factor 2/N is handled properly throughout.
• The 3D cost surface is a particularly strong visualization; the grid
  approach is correct and the explanation in the surrounding markdown
  is appropriate.
• Feature normalization in Notebook 2 demonstrates awareness of
  numerical stability requirements for gradient descent.
• The interaction-weight sweep (w_MT cost curve) is a thoughtful
  experiment that goes slightly beyond the minimum requirement.
• Dataset is physically motivated (real stellar mass-luminosity
  relationship) and clearly labeled in both notebooks.
• All computations are reproducible from a clean Python + NumPy +
  Matplotlib environment without any external ML dependency.

-----------------------------------------------------------
ISSUES & MISSING ELEMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------
• [CRITICAL – MANDATORY] Convergence plot missing in Notebook 1.
  The training loop records losses but no loss-vs-epoch curve is
  plotted or discussed for any of the three learning rates.
• [CRITICAL – MANDATORY] Convergence plot missing in Notebook 2.
  Same issue: losses[] accumulated but never visualized.
• [NOTABLE] Final fitted-line overlay plot absent in Notebook 1.
  There is no plot showing the learned linear model on top of the
  scatter data, making it impossible to visually assess the fit.
• [MINOR] Non-vectorized gradient descent not exercised in training.
  gradients_loop is defined and correct, but train() always uses
  gradients_vectorized. A brief side-by-side comparison or validation
  run would complete the requirement.
• [MINOR] Inference result in Notebook 2 lacks interpretive discussion.
  Only a number is printed; the student should explain whether the
  value is physically plausible and how it compares to nearby
  training samples.
• [MINOR] README SageMaker screenshot links are broken (wrong relative
  path). Should be img/image.png, img/image-1.png, img/image-2.png.
• [MINOR] No local vs. cloud comparison discussion in the README.

-----------------------------------------------------------
TA FEEDBACK TO STUDENT
-----------------------------------------------------------
You have built a technically sound foundation: the mathematics are
correct, the code is clean, and the overall structure of both notebooks
is logical. To bring this submission to a higher level, please address
the following:

1. Add convergence plots to both notebooks. After training with each
   learning rate (Notebook 1) or each model variant (Notebook 2), plot
   the loss curve over epochs. Discuss what you observe: does it
   converge quickly or slowly? Does the curve flatten early, suggesting
   convergence, or does it continue declining?

2. Add a final fit visualization in Notebook 1. Plot the learned linear
   model L_hat = w·M + b overlaid on the original scatter data. This
   makes the systematic errors (where the linear model under- or
   over-predicts) immediately visible and ties back to your discussion
   of linearity limits.

3. Demonstrate the non-vectorized gradient descent in training. Even a
   brief cell that verifies that gradients_loop and gradients_vectorized
   return numerically identical results — or that training with the loop
   version reaches the same final loss — would complete this requirement.

4. Expand the inference interpretation in Notebook 2. State whether the
   predicted luminosity is physically consistent with what we know about
   a star of M=1.3 and T=6600 K, compare it to the nearest training
   point, and comment on the reliability of the extrapolation.

5. Fix the README image paths (add the img/ prefix) so that the
   SageMaker screenshots are visible to any reviewer reading the
   repository on GitHub.

These are all relatively small additions that would significantly
strengthen the submission.

AI-GENERATION ASSESSMENT  (NON-GRADING, INFORMATIONAL ONLY)
-----------------------------------------------------------

A. Qualitative Assessment

   Indicators consistent with AI-assisted generation:
   – Markdown explanations follow a uniform template (one-sentence
     section header, two-sentence description) across both notebooks
     with very little variation in depth or tone.
   – Code is syntactically clean and free of debugging artifacts,
     commented-out alternatives, or iterative refinements that typically
     appear in human-authored exploratory notebooks.
   – Variable naming is perfectly consistent throughout (M, L, T, w, b,
     dw, db) with no typos or mid-session renames.
   – Error discussion in the closing markdown of Notebook 1 uses generic
     phrasing ("captura la tendencia general", "presentará errores
     sistemáticos") without referencing specific numerical results from
     the run.
   – The README structure mirrors a standard template (Description,
     Notebooks, Data, Requirements, Execution, Results, Cloud, Author).

   Indicators consistent with human involvement:
   – The physical dataset (stellar masses and luminosities) is curated
     to reflect the real mass-luminosity relation (roughly L ∝ M^4),
     suggesting domain awareness rather than random example data.
   – The choice of axis ranges for the cost surface grid (w: -5 to 10,
     b: -10 to 10) is specific to the data scale, implying some manual
     tuning.
   – The SageMaker screenshots were captured and organized by a human.

B. Quantitative Estimate
   Code:                  ~70%  AI-assisted
   Explanations/markdown: ~80%  AI-assisted
   README:                ~75%  AI-assisted

C. Commentary
   The submission exhibits the hallmarks of AI-assisted authoring: highly
   uniform prose structure, clean boilerplate code with no exploratory
   residue, and generic interpretive comments that do not reference the
   actual numerical outputs of the cells. However, the physical dataset
   and specific parameter choices suggest meaningful human direction of
   the AI tool rather than fully autonomous generation. The SageMaker
   execution evidence is clearly human-initiated. This assessment is
   observational and does not imply misconduct.
